This bug occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native with a large dataset. The performance becomes slow and choppy, especially when scrolling. This is because FlatList renders all items at once, which can lead to performance issues.  The code below shows an example where FlatList is used with a large dataset, resulting in poor performance.
```javascript
<FlatList
  data={largeDataset}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <ItemComponent item={item} />}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
/>
```
